The goal of this project was to create a Password Generator.  The password would be randomized with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special character, if desired.  The password created must be 8 or more characters in length.

The purpose of this project was to practice and apply concepts learned after the third week of our Coding Bootcamp.

This is an html file with a CSS stylesheet and JS.

Below are a few select screenshots of the Password Generator.
